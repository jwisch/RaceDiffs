ABSTRACT 
Importance: African Americans have been identified as potentially having a greater risk for developing Alzheimer Disease (AD).  Genetic, social (psychosocial), environmental, and cardiovascular factors may increase the risk of AD.  

Objectives: 1) Assess neuroimaging biomarkers of amyloid (A), tau (T), and neurodegeneration (N) for potential racial differences. 2) Consider mediating effects of socioeconomic status and cardiovascular risk factors on observed race differences.
Design, Setting, and Participants: 1105 participants (African American (n= 169) and Caucasian (n=936)) enrolled in studies at the Knight Alzheimer Disease Research Center (ADRC) were evaluated using imaging biomarkers, including positron emission tomography (PET) for amyloid (A) and tau (T) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) (both structural and resting state functional connectivity (rs-fc)) for neurodegeneration (N).  Cardiovascular (white matter hyperintensities on MRI, blood pressure, and body mass index (BMI)) and socioeconomic status (area-level socioeconomic status as defined by the area deprivation index (ADI)) measures were included in mediation analyses.

Results: Compared to Caucasian participants, African American participants had lower amyloid PET accumulation but greater neurodegeneration, as measured by decreased cortical volumes and decreased global intra-network rs-fc. African Americans also had lower socioeconomic status (SES), higher blood pressure, higher BMI, and greater WMH volumes. These proposed mediators significantly influenced relationships between race and cortical amyloid PET accumulation, AD cortical signature volume, and intra-network rs-fc signature. ADI in particular was a significant mediating factor.

Conclusions and Relevance: Observed racial differences in AD are not primarily due to immutable, genetic differences. Rather, these observations are driven by modifiable factors fueled by differences in social context and resources, especially area-level SES. Future studies should emphasize collection of relevant psychosocial factors (e.g. measures of stress, healthcare access, etc.) in addition to recruitment of participants from varied racial and economic backgrounds.
